#playlist

This project was one I made for my Data Structures class, in which I implemented a number of data structures to create a playlist displayed through GUI. The data of the playlist is garnered from a .txt and read and transferred into a LinkedList, and one is able to display this playlist in multiple orders, as well as add, delete, and find songs on the playlist.
